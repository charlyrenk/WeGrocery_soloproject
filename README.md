# Name of Project
My solo project was an application called WeGrocery. WeGrocery is a full-stack
web application to help a usersâ€™ create, share, and co-edit grocery lists. For
grocery-list editing, users will have the option to mark whether or not they have
specific items on a list; this list change will update for all shared-list users to
see. Users will also have the option to add notes to each specific grocery item
and the ability to add on to or remove items from a list. All of these changes will
update-real time on any shared list.
To see/ test out my application, use my Heroku link here on a mobile device:
<https://wegrocery.herokuapp.com>.
